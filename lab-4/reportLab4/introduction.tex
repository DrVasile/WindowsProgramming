\section{Purpose of the laboratory}
Gain knowledge about basics of working timer, its usage and how to implement animations.

\section{Laboratory Work Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mandatory Objectives}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects;
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Objectives With Points:}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item (2 pt) Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel;
		      \item (2 pt) Solve flickering problem, please describe in your readme/report how you did it;
		      \item Add animated objects which interact with each other (2-6 pt), ex.:
		      \begin{itemize}
		      	  \item Few balls which have different velocity and moving angles. In order to get max points, add balls with mouse, make balls to change color on interaction and any other things that will show your engineering spirit;
		      	  \item Any other interesting and reach in animation application;
		      \end{itemize}
	          \item Animate a Nyan Cat that leaves a rainbow tail (Math.floor(+35\% for task with interacting objects))
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
